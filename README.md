nwsweatheralertswidget
======================

Android home screen widget to display current weather alerts from the US National Weather Service

I created this because I wanted a tablet on the wall in my kitchen to display weather alerts on the screen, and for all the plethora of weather apps out there, I couldn't find one that showed anything more than a (!) icon on their widgets for alerts, and you had to click through to find out what they were.  Some of them would put the alerts into the notification bar, but that wasn't much better.  So this one displays a list of the current alerts right on the widget, and that is the only purpose of the widget.

There's also an app with a user interface to go with it, mostly for debugging. :)  The app lets you look at the raw XML feed from the NWS, for example.

Right now it's hard-coded to use Ottawa County, MI (my home county) while I'm testing it.  A county selector is coming soon.
